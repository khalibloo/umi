# Upgrade to Umi 3


This document will help you upgrade from Umi 2.x to Umi 3.x.

## package.json

Change the version of `umi` to` ^ 3.0.0` or above.

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "umi": "^2"
+   "umi": "^3"
  }
}
```

Since Umi 3 requires Node 10.13 or above, if you have engines before, you need to confirm the version number.

## tsconfig.json

In order to have a better ts prompt, you need to configure `@@` as `[" src / .umi / * "]`.

```diff
+ "@@/*": ["src/.umi/*"]
```

## Upgrade umi-plugin-react to @umijs/preset-react

If you have used `umi-plugin-react` before, here are the modification steps.

First modify the dependencies in package.json,

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "umi-plugin-react": "^1"
+   "@umijs/preset-react": "^1"
  }
}
```

Then, because the configuration of Umi 3 is flat, you need to modify the configuration.

```diff
export default {
- plugins: [
-   ['umi-plugin-react', {
-     dva: {},
-     antd: {},
-     ...
-   }]
- ],
+ dva: {},
+ antd: {},
+ ...
}
```

note:

1. No need to register plugins repeatedly, Umi 3 will automatically register Umi plugins in dependencies
2. Extract the configuration to the outside

Functional change,

* Routes, library, dll, hardSource, pwa, hd, fastClick, chunks have been deleted and can no longer be used
* Built-in dynamicImport, title, scripts, headScripts, metas and links into Umi, you can continue to use
* Other functions are unchanged

## Configuration layer

Umi 3 has made a lot of streamlining in the configuration layer. The following modifications are sorted alphabetically for easy searching.

* Delete browserslist, duplicate targets
* Remove babel, basically no need
* Modify cssLoaderOptions as cssLoader
* Remove cssLoaderVersion and keep only css-loader @ 2
* Remove cssPublicPath. The relative path `./` For resource files referenced by css can meet all scenarios, no need to configure
* Remove disableGlobalVariables, there are always no global variables, no configuration required
* Remove disableRedirectHoist and never do redirect hoist
* Remove disableCSSModules and cssModulesWithAffix, Umi 3 automatically recognizes the use of css modules without configuration
* Remove extraBabelIncludes and es5ImcompatibleVersions, node\_modules is also meaningless after compiling with babel, no configuration required
* Change the history format to `{type, options}`, no longer support string format
* Modify lessLoaderOptions as lessLoader
* Remove minimizer, keep only terserjs
* Modify the format of plugins as a string. You need to ensure that the dependent plugins are upgraded to Umi 3 first, and then refer to the previous umi-plugin-react modification
* Remove sass, no longer supported, will be provided as a plugin in the future
* Remove treeShaking, built-in, no configuration required
* Delete tsConfigFile, no need
* Removed typescript, after the TypeScript compilation was handed over to babel, the previous configuration of ts-loader would be meaningless
* Remove uglifyJSOptions, no need
* Remove urlLoaderExcludes, no need

## Environment variable layer

## Code layer

### import all from umi

The interface of `umi/xxx` is no longer retained, and all are imported from umi.

such as:

```diff
- import Link from 'umi/link';
+ import { Link } from 'umi';
```

### umi/router

Use `history` instead.

```diff
- import router from 'umi/router';
+ import { history } from 'umi';

- router.push('/foo');
+ history.push('/foo');
```

### Reference aliases or third-party libraries in CSS

Need to be prefixed with `~`.

such as:

```diff
# Alias
- background: url(@/assets/logo.png);
+ background: url(~@/assets/logo.png);

# Third party library
- @import url(foo/bar.css');
- @import url(~foo/bar.css');
```
