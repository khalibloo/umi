## Contributing documents

Umi uses Umi itself + dumi plugin as a documentation tool,

1. The bottom left of each document is "Edit this document on GitHub", you can modify the document here
2. Open the [docs on Github](https://github.com/umijs/umi/tree/master/docs) directory, use the file editor to create, modify, preview files, and then submit PR
3. You can also clone the [Umi repository](https://github.com/umijs/umi), modify the files in the docs directory, and uniformly improve the PR after the local documents are debugged.
